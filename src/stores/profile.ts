  about: `Simon has been working as a software engineer since 2006, in which time he's done work
for the likes of Gitpod, DPD, Specsavers, British Pathé, the Red Cross and others. Initially specialising
in the NodeJS ecosystem, he's used pretty much all of the major languages over the years and since 2017
has been focused on building DevOps solutions and Cloud-native applications that help engineers to
work faster and more productively.

When not behind a computer he's a keen gardener, beekeeper and makes his own sausages.

He hates talking about himself in the third person.`,
