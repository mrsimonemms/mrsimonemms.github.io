  about: `Simon has been working as a software engineer since 2006, in which time
he's worked with Temporal, Gitpod, DPD, the Red Cross and others. Initially
specialising in the NodeJS ecosystem, he's used pretty much all of the major
languages over the years. Since 2017, he  has been focused on building Cloud
Native applications that help engineers to work more productively and ship
faster.

When not behind a computer he's a keen gardener, beekeeper and makes his own sausages.

He hates talking about himself in the third person.`,
