title: Tech is broken. And AI won't help.

excerpt: |
  Tech is at a crisis point. Companies won't recruit junior engineers to train up. Agile was designed to improve productivity, but ceremonies are followed ritualistically. Recruitment often focuses on meaningless trivia. The current trend in industry is to look to AI as a panacea. Unless we solve the underlying issues, AI will compound these problems rather than being the solution.

This came from a place that all good opinion pieces should come from - a bad
recruitment experience and chatting with a mate in the pub. I spoke with a VP of
Engineering  recently who was looking for a leader for his Platform Team. The first
call went something like this:

> Hi Simon. We've got a load of problems in our Platform Team. We're need an
> opinionated leader to come in an address our problems. As this is a leadership
> role, it'll be a two-stage process and there will be no tech test.

I was very pleased when I heard all that. A leader needs to be able to have
opinions when solving problems as that's part of the autonomy. And I hate
[tech tests](/blog/2023/01/28/i-am-an-ex-podder) and drawn-out recruitment
processes because they don't help with answering the questions you need in finding
the right person.

Naturally, I was very disappointed when he then told me after the first call that
there would actually be 3 stages, one of which being a literal whole day of calls
with every Tom, Dick and Harry in the company (including the CEO). When I questioned
this based on our initial call, he dismissed this as "just my opinion". In one
fell swoop, the three things that attracted me to the role were removed.

When I discussed this later with a friend of mine, we then thought about how AI
will end up making all this worse.

## Recruitment and staffing

Tech companies don't know how to recruit engineers. Really.

We don't even know how many rounds of interviews to have or even with whom. Over
my career I've seen very senior people hired after a single meeting and junior
people expected to go through multiple rounds followed by dinner with the CEO.
Where is the consistency?

And each round should have a specific purpose. Personally, I won't normally do
anything that's more than two rounds - the first person is so you can see if you
can work together, the second to see if you both have the skillset to **keep each
other happy** - even for junior roles, both parties are interviewing each other.

Stupid numbers of rounds are pointless. A friend of mine went to work for a
[FAANG company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) a few years ago and they
had about 9 rounds of interviews. When he got the role, he asked his boss why
there was so many rounds. The response was:

> We put so many rounds in so that people effectively self-select for the job.

That's pretty insane for FAANG, but it's utter madness for a startup with 10
engineers. For a start, just think of the time cost of hiring 2 engineers from a
pool of 10 candidates.

### Technical skills

How do we probe an engineer's technical skills? Is it best to have a test?

If so:
 - Is that on a whiteboard, leetcode, paired programming or something else?
 - How do you ensure that there's parity between what you're testing and
   objective reality, assuming objective reality even exists?
 - What happens if you're interviewing someone who's neurodivergent and struggles
   to concentrate when someone's staring at them? Even if they're neurotypical,
   anyone who hass ever given a public demo knows that the demo gods can curse
   you at any time and it's not unknown for them to make an appearance in technical
   tests too.
 - What if, like me, you're just not very good at technical tests? I'm pretty
   bloody good at my job ([honest](/#testimonials)), but I just struggle with the
   dryness of a tech test.

So, let's assume we decide against a test. How do we make sure that we're hiring
someone who can do the job and hasn't just managed to successfully bullshit their
way through their career?

My sister is involved with interviewing surgeons for NHS England and I asked her
how they hire. As an engineer, my assumption was that there would be some form
of "please amputate this leg so we can see how you think" type question. In
actuality, they can't do a technical test as people are quite attached to their
legs, so it's compentency questions, work history, professional accreditation
and gut feel.

If that's good enough for doctors, why do we need more for someone building a
React website?

### Feedback loops

Modern software engineering is all about feedback loops. The DevOps lifecycle is
one giant feedback loops after all.

How do we get feedback on our recruitment process? We ask the people who go
through it.

People who want to impress us.

Or who are pissed off that we didn't give them the job.

Maybe I'm a bit cynical in my old age, but I don't think this feedback will be
100% objective...

### Let's just follow FAANG

In the end, a lot of companies read what the FAANG companies do a just follow
that. And as anyone who's ever been asked to build a prototype for a new business
idea with the scaling requirements of Google knows, startups and FAANG ain't the
same.

So why would anyone expect us to recruit the same? You might be able to have a
recruitment process with eleventy rounds because "that's what Facebook does", but
your startup doesn't have the cachet of Facebook so people will be more likely
to withdraw.
