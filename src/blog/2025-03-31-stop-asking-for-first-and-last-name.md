I love [Formula One](https://www.formula1.com/). The first grand prix I remember
watching was the
[1993 European Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_European_Grand_Prix)
at Donington Park, with our Easter Sunday lunches on our laps on my brother's 14"
TV after our main TV blew up a few days earlier. I love the speed, the people,
the history and the incredible people I've bonded with over 30 years as a fan. I
also love how it's a gateway into countries and cultures that you didn't see
growing up in 1990s [Kidderminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidderminster).

That first race I watched was won by [Ayrton Senna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna).
To the British audience, his name was simply "Air-tun" but it was around this time
that commentator [Murray Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Walker)
realised that's not how "Ayrton" was pronounced. So he switched to a (more) correct
"Eye-air-tun". Being the nerdy kid I was/still am I thought this was interesting,
so I looked up Senna in my library's encyclopedia and found that his last name
wasn't actually "Senna".

It was "da Silva".

So I read more to understand why he wasn't "Ayrton da Silva" and was known by his
middle name. And the more I read, the more I learned about Portuguese and Brazilian
names - "Senna" wasn't his middle name, but his mother's surname and da Silva was
his father's. "Da Silva" is a really common surname in Brazil and he wanted to be
special and "Senna" was fairly rare. The Portuguese naming convention is
`<first name> <mother's surname> <father's surname>`.

## What's this got to do with engineering in 2025?

A lot of the modern world requires us to complete web forms. And the first questions
are usually "first name" and "last name". Two separate questions, often with a
validation making it a required field. No variations.

But what, if like our Portuguese-speaking friends, you not simply have a first
and last name? You're forcing them to make a decision to complete your form. And
that's a decision on their name, perhaps the piece of information that is most
central to someone's identity.

I have never seen my actual ethnicity on a form. My father is British, my mother
is Ukrainian and I'm proud of my heritage that spans Europe. So I tend to decline
to answer. In truth, that's not something that causes much harm because it's
accepted to not answer. But one's name is not something you can decline to answer
just because you've been asked your first and last names by an Anglo-centric thinker.

## But that's just Portuguese. It's fine for everyone else.

As so often is the case when thinking of F1 greats, sooner or later you come to
[Fernando Alonso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso).

Sorry, Fernando Alonso Diaz.

Aaaah great, so using our logic from Mr Senna, we know that his mum was Alonso
and his dad was Diaz, right?

Nope. That's Portuguese naming conventions. And Alonso is Spanish. And despite
being next door on the Iberian peninsula and having intertwined histories and
cultures, they do the opposite of the Portuguese - they go
`<first name> <father's surname> <mother's surname>`.

## Ok. But everyone's got a first name right?

## Fine. We're cool with surnames though?

## So what do we do?
